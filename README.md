# Evacuation_Hospital_Building
GAML source code for Integration of Evacuee Categorization in an Agent-Based Simulation for Enhancing Building Evacuation in Case of Fire Breakout

# To execute a .gaml code using the GAMA platform, follow these steps:

1. Download and Install GAMA: Ensure you have the latest version of the GAMA platform installed on your computer. You can download it from the official GAMA website (https://gama-platform.org).
2. Open GAMA: Launch the GAMA application.
3. Create a New Model: Go to the File menu and select New Model. This will create a new .gaml file.
4. Write or Import Your Code: You can either write your code directly in the GAMA editor or import your existing .gaml file using the Import option in the File menu.
5. Set Up Your Experiment: Define the parameters of your experiment in the code, such as the number of agents, environmental settings, etc.
6. Run the Model: After writing or importing your code, click the Run button in the toolbar to start the simulation. You can also press F11.
7. Visualize the Results: Watch the results of the simulation in the various visualization tabs offered by GAMA, such as graphs, maps, and 3D views.
8. Adjust and Iterate: If necessary, adjust your code and rerun the simulation to observe the changes.

# System Requirement for this source code
GAMA 1.6 or ++
